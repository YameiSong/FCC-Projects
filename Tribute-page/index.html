            <p>Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom,
                handicraft, and warfare, who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded
                as
                the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which
                she most
                likely received her name. She is usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major
                symbols
                include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion.</p>

            <p>From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known
                as
                Polias and Poliouchos (both derived from polis, meaning "city-state"), and her temples were usually
                located atop
                the fortified Acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is
                dedicated to
                her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was
                known as
                Ergane. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as Athena
                Promachos. Her
                main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in
                midsummer
                and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.</p>

            <p>In Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father Zeus. In the
                founding myth
                of Athens, Athena bested Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first
                olive tree.
                She was known as Athena Parthenos ("Athena the Virgin"), but, in one archaic Attic myth, the god
                Hephaestus
                tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important Athenian
                founding
                hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have also aided the heroes
                Perseus,
                Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses
                whose
                feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War. She plays an active role in the Iliad, in which she
                assists
                the Achaeans and, in the Odyssey, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus.</p>

            <p>In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne
                in a
                weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she
                transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the
                Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and classical learning.
                Western
                artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.</p>
